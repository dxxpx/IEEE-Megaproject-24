## Domain of the Project
Crowd Souurcced Disaster Management

## Idea
SAFE REACH is a crowd-sourced disaster management application designed to operate effectively even without internet connectivity. It allows users to request assistance (medical, food, SOS), report local issues (e.g., roadblocks, fallen trees), and find or donate essential resources such as groceries and medical supplies. Admins and rescuers receive detailed distress calls, post real-time updates, and provide emergency guidelines to the affected communities.

**Key Features:**
 - **Offline Functionality:** Utilizes LoRa and ESP32 modules to ensure communication even in network-deprived areas.
 - **Crowd-Powered Disaster Mapping:** Users contribute live updates to build a dynamic and responsive disaster map.
 -  **All-in-One Platform:** Combines communication, resource management, real-time updates, and rescue coordination in a single platform.
 - **Resource Donation Network:** Users can donate and locate essential supplies, fostering community resilience.
